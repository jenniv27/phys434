    "We're going to briefly look at truth tables. As an example let's assume we have a 100 photos, some of birds and some of people. In a truth table you assume you can categorize the true answerâ€”let's say you pay an undergraduate to sort the photos into birds and people. Then you want to have an automated sorting algorithm. However that works, whether it is by looking a the color at the center of photo or using a neural network (NN), it will also sort the photos but imperfectly. Given two sorts you can then arrange a truth table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  | True Bird| True Person|\n",
    "|----|----|----------|\n",
    "| NN Bird | 45  | 5  |\n",
    "| NN Person| 3  | 47 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 48 birds and 52 People (columns), and there are 8 miscategorizations. The NN called three of the birds people, and 5 of the people birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because it not only shows the number of errors, but the type, and not all errors are created equal. Let's say our identification system is being used to keep birds from escaping the aviary at the zoo by locking the aviary door when a bird is trying to escape. We really don't want to let birds escape, but locking a person in for 30 extra seconds is not a big deal. In this case false bird identification is not so bad, but false person identification lets a bird escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the above truth table is the current system, and you've developed a new algorithm (NA) with the following truth table*: \n",

    "|----|----|----------|\n",
    "| NA Bird | 47  | 10  |\n",
    "| NA Person| 1  | 42 |\n",
    "\n",
    "*the given truth table in the homework 3 file is 11 True persons classified as NA Birds, and 42 True Persons classified as NA Persons, however this would mean the table does not add up to 100. Let's work with 10 True Person/NA Bird and 42 True Person/NA Person instead."

    "The second algorithm is better for the zoo. The zoo wants to prioritize the algorithm to identify birds correctly, as it is more important to not let birds escape. It is less important to the zoo if they identify people incorrectly, because it isn't a big deal for them to lock a person in with the birds for 30 extra seconds. Therefore, there is a much greater penalty involved with identifying a true bird as a person. If we look at the number of times each algorithm identifies true birds as people, the new algorithm (NA) has only 1 occurrence, while the neural network (NN) has 3. Thus, the second algorithm is better for the zoo."
