All studies should be carried out by normalizing Higgs and QCD samples in each pT sample to give expected yields accordingly (See Dataset descriptions).__\n",

    "In this lab, my partner and I will be optimizing the event selections in our LHC training samples. I will be working with the low PT training sample datasets, which come in two files: the QCD background dataset and the Higgs Boson signal dataset. There are 100k total events (jets) in each data set. The expected yield for the Higgs Boson signal data is 100 jets and the expected yield for QCD background data is 20,000 jets.\n",

In this case, I will create a stacked histogram by accessing the data from each file, creating a two-dimensional array with 100,000 rows and 2 columns, which contains the mass measurement from all jet events in both the background and the Higgs signal data. Once I plot this on the stacked histogram I will distinguish them by color."
